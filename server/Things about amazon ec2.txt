This is about Amazon EC2
--------------------------

* When an instance is stopped, the elastic ip will be de-associated, and thus we need to associate it back once we restart the instance

* Increasing the size of instance:
	- Go to volume, create snapshot from an instance
	- Go to snapshot to see if the snapshot is ready, and create a new volume from that snapshot
	- Stop (not terminate) the instance, and go back to volume to detach the old volume. 
	- Attach the new volume (be sure to take note of the device in the old volume which is normally /dev/sda1)
	- Re-associate the ip back and login to the instance through ssh
	- Check to see hard disk size: df -h, and you should see it's still the same as old one. This is because we haven't mount it the space of new volume.
	- use command: resize2fs /dev/xvda1
	+ Cool... you're good to go
